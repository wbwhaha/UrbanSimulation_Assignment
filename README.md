# US_Assignment

Since the assessment consists of two parts, there are two separate juypter notebook files in the **'Code'** folder, and a qmd file for rendering the pdf. Since the qmd file needs to be rendered in its own path, the final pdf file is also located in the **'Code'** folder.  

The submitted pdf file may lack spaces, which may cause a formatting issue. The title **'Scenario'** is not rendered in bold, resulting in missing hyperlinks. The file in this repository has been formatted and the content is exactly the same.
