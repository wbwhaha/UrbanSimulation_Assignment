	abstract = {Whilst being hailed as the remedy to the world’s ills, cities will need to adapt in the 21st century. In particular, the role of public transport is likely to increase significantly, and new methods and technics to better plan transit systems are in dire need. This paper examines one fundamental aspect of transit: network centrality. By applying the notion of betweenness centrality to 28 worldwide metro systems, the main goal of this paper is to study the emergence of global trends in the evolution of centrality with network size and examine several individual systems in more detail. Betweenness was notably found to consistently become more evenly distributed with size (i.e. no “winner takes all”) unlike other complex network properties. Two distinct regimes were also observed that are representative of their structure. Moreover, the share of betweenness was found to decrease in a power law with size (with exponent 1 for the average node), but the share of most central nodes decreases much slower than least central nodes (0.87 vs. 2.48). Finally the betweenness of individual stations in several systems were examined, which can be useful to locate stations where passengers can be redistributed to relieve pressure from overcrowded stations. Overall, this study offers significant insights that can help planners in their task to design the systems of tomorrow, and similar undertakings can easily be imagined to other urban infrastructure systems (e.g., electricity grid, water/wastewater system, etc.) to develop more sustainable cities.},

Here, the daily population flow data of 346 cities during the Spring Festival travel rush in China were combined with different travel modes to measure the spatial structure and spatial patterns of an intercity trip network of Chinese residents. These data were then used for a comprehensive depiction of the complex relationships between the population flows of cities. The results showed that there were obvious differences in the characteristics of urban networks from the perspective of different modes of travel. The intercity flow of aviation trips showed a core-periphery structure with national hub cities as the core distribution. Trips by train showed a core-periphery structure with cities along the national railway artery as the core. This gradually decreased toward hinterland cities. Moreover, the intercity flow of highway trips indicated a spatial pattern of strong local aggregation that matched the population scale.},

	abstract = {In the extensive urban rail transit network, interruptions will lead to service delays on the current line and spread to other lines, forcing many passengers to wait, detour, or even give up their trips. This paper proposes an event-driven simulation method to evaluate the impact of interruptions on passenger flow distribution. With this method, passengers are regarded as individual agents who can obtain complete information about the current traffic situation, and the impact of the occurrence, duration, and recovery of interruption events on passengers’ travel decisions is analyzed in detail. Then, two modes are used to assign passenger paths: experience-based pre-trip mode and response-based entrap mode. In the simulation process, the train is regarded as an individual agent with a fixed capacity. With the advance of the simulation clock, the network loading is completed through the interaction of the three agents of passengers, platforms, and trains. Interruption events are considered triggers, affecting other agents by affecting network topology and train schedules. Finally, taking Chongqing Metro as an example, the accuracy and effectiveness of the model are analyzed and verified. And the impact of interruption on passenger flow distribution indicators such as inbound volume, outbound volume, and transfer volume is studied from both the individual and overall dimensions. The results show that this study provides an effective method for calculating the passenger flow distribution of an extensive urban rail transit network in the case of interruption.},

The three sorts of information about nodes’ positions that are usually used—which we refer to as “nodal statistics”—are the paths from a given node to other nodes, the walks from a given node to other nodes, and the geodesics between other nodes that include a given node. Using such statistics on nodes’ positions, we also characterize the types of trees such that centrality measures all agree, and we also discuss the properties that identify some path-based centrality measures.},

	abstract = {The study of transportation networks covers a wide range of topics related to managing services and maintaining structures. In order to represent the topological structure of such a network, we associated a graph to a network. Then some different properties or attributes of the network can be managed as weights to be applied to the graph itself. In addition, different centrality indices can be computed in order to identify nodes or edges that are more important or more exposed to capacity changes (such as, for example, disruptive events). The purpose of this research is to provide a methodology for dynamically evaluating the significance of stations in a transportation network. This is accomplished through two distinct phases of activity. Firstly, we propose a dynamic analysis of the underground transportation system of the city of Milan, Italy. This transportation system is the mobility backbone of the city and counts four lines with 110 links and 107 stations, including 21 junctions (the transfer stations that connect the lines). Two data sets about passenger flows (both entering and leaving stations) are used to calculate the flows on links with a resolution of 1 min. The data sets refer to a week in 2018, without the changes in demand due to the pandemic scenario. Data are processed through an ad hoc written assignment procedure. Secondly, a centrality index is calculated by using passenger flows (entering, exiting, and on-segments) as weights of the underground graph. After maps reporting the outcomes of those calculations are drawn, an image comparison is carried out by using image processing tools and different aggregation intervals, in order to investigate how the importance or exposure of each station changes over time. The findings demonstrate that over time, indices vary by station, with junction stations naturally having the highest values. By increasing the observation interval from 1 min up to 30 min, index changes become progressively smoother, like an application of a low pass filter, suggesting that for certain applications (e.g. those concerning security), aggregating data could lead to misleading conclusions.},

This brief studies the vulnerability analysis and recognition of key nodes in power grids from a complex network perspective. Based on the ac power flow model and the network topology weighted with admittance, the cascading failure model is established first. The node electrical centrality is further pointed out, using complex network centrality theory, to identify the key nodes in power grids. To effectively analyze the behavior and verify the correctness of node electrical centrality, the net-ability and vulnerability index are introduced to describe the transfer ability and performance under normal operation and assess the vulnerability of the power system under cascading failures, respectively. Simulation results of IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus test cases show that the key nodes can be effectively identified with high electrical centrality, the resultant cascading failures that eventually lead to a severe decrease in net-ability, verifying the correctness and effectiveness of the analysis.},

We extract nationwide inter-urban movements in China from a check-in data set that covers half a million individuals within 370 cities to analyze the underlying patterns of trips and spatial interactions. By fitting the gravity model, we find that the observed spatial interactions are governed by a power law distance decay effect. The obtained gravity model also closely reproduces the exponential trip displacement distribution. The movement of an individual, however, may not obey the same distance decay effect, leading to an ecological fallacy. We also construct a spatial network where the edge weights denote the interaction strengths. The communities detected from the network are spatially cohesive and roughly consistent with province boundaries. We attribute this pattern to different distance decay parameters between intra-province and inter-province trips.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a flexible gravity-opportunities model for trip distribution in which standard forms of the gravity and opportunities models are obtained as special cases of a general opportunities (GO) model. Hence the question of choice between gravity or opportunities approaches is decided empirically and statistically by restrictions on parameters which control the global functional form of the trip distribution mechanism. The test for the gravity model is shown to be equivalent to a test of the IIA axiom where alternatives are destinations. The notational dichotomy between the two approaches is resolved by employing ordered trip matrices and transformations to permit row and column sum constraints to be applied. These constraints, often interpreted in various ways, are treated as normalisation terms and are therefore not strictly part of the form of the model. Doubly constrained, singly constrained and unconstrained versions of both models are developed throughout. A key step in the integration is the specification of an opportunity function which has as arguments destination-attribute variables such population, income or some other measure of opportunities and generalized cost/impedance-type variables relating origin and destination. This device obviates the mutual exclusiveness ordinarily required of these two sets of variables. The opportunity function is incorporated into a general proportionality factor which is defined by the difference in functions of cumulative opportunities; the latter are subjected to a convex combination of direct and inverse Box-Cox transformations. Different values of the parameters controlling these transformations generate contrasting families of models, notably the exponential and logarithmic intervening opportunities models and the gravity model. All models are shown to be embedded in a transformed triangular region over which likelihood function, response surface or simultaneous confidence interval contours may be plotted. These generalised gravity-opportunity concepts are applied to two well-known models: direct demand multimodal travel demand models, and the estimation of the OD matrix from link volumes. The second case is estimated empirically and here it is shown that a significant improvement is obtained over the gravity model, which is rejected, along with the logarithmic intervening opportunity model, in favour of a more general direct opportunities version.},

Two particular concepts seem to be particularly relevant: scale-free patterns and small-worlds. By looking at 33 metro systems in the world, this paper adapts network science methodologies to the transportation literature, and offers one application to the robustness of metros; here, metro refers to urban rail transit with exclusive right-of-way, whether it is underground, at grade or elevated. We find that most metros are indeed scale-free (with scaling factors ranging from 2.10 to 5.52) and small-worlds; they show atypical behaviors, however, with increasing size. In particular, the presence of transfer-hubs (stations hosting more than three lines) results in relatively large scaling factors. The analysis provides insights/recommendations for increasing the robustness of metro networks. Smaller networks should focus on creating transfer stations, thus generating cycles to offer alternative routes. For larger networks, few stations seem to detain a certain monopole on transferring, it is therefore important to create additional transfers, possibly at the periphery of city centers; the Tokyo system seems to remarkably incorporate these properties.},

Then, the above-mentioned relationships between perceptions, satisfaction, and intentions of users concerning the LRT service were estimated with the use of a structural equation model (SEM) approach. Three SEMs were calibrated: one for all the users, one for captive users, and one for noncaptive users of the service.

For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network1. Complex communication networks2 display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web3,4,5, the Internet6, social networks7 and cells8. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

	abstract = {Intra-urban human mobility is investigated by means of taxi trajectory data that are collected in Shanghai, China, where taxis play an important role in urban transportation. From the taxi trajectories, approximately 1.5 million trips of anonymous customers are extracted on seven consecutive days. The globally spatio-temporal patterns of trips exhibit a significant daily regularity. Since each trip can be viewed as a displacement in the random walk model, the distributions of the distance and direction of the extracted trips are investigated in this research. The direction distribution shows an NEE–SWW-dominant direction, and the distance distribution can be well fitted by an exponentially truncated power law, with the scaling exponent β = 1.2 ± 0.15. The observed patterns are attributed to the geographical heterogeneity of the study area, which makes the spatial distribution of trajectory stops to be non-uniform. We thus construct a model that integrates both the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect, to interpret the observed patterns. Our Monte Carlo simulation results closely match to the observed patterns and thus validate the proposed model. According to the proposed model, in a single-core urban area, the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect improve each other when influencing human mobility patterns. Geographical heterogeneity leads to a faster observed decay, and the distance decay effect makes the spatial distribution of trips more concentrated.},
